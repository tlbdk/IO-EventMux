# This tests how we handle a premature disconnect where a socket is 
# disconnected before we have called mux on it.
#
# It also looks at the order of the events pr. file handle so we are sure 
# EventMux returns them in the correct order:
#
# 1. connect or connected: Is the first event depending if it's from a 
#    accept call(ie. a child of a listening socket) or a connecting socket.
# 2. read, canread: is optional and might not happen as the other end can quit
#    before sending any data.
# 3. disconnect: Happens when using delayed disconnect, all disconnects EventMux 
#    detects is delayed. The user has to call disconnect($fh, 1); to get this 
#    event.
# 4. disconnected: Is the last event a file handle can generate.
