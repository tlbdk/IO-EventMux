Version 2.02 ()
 * mux() will now return undef when the event queue is empty, there are no 
   handles to watch and there is no timeouts to wait for, this was done to make
   it easier to drop out of the loop when there are no chance that any events 
   will be generated.

Version 2.01 (Sun Apr 15 2009)
 * Remove IO::Epoll as default mistake

Version 2.01 (Sun Apr 15 2009)
 * Added pluggable EventLoop mechanism and added support for IO::Epool 
 * Fixed tests so there is no more hard dependence on IO::Buffered
 * Small fix for IO::EventMux::Dump eating options.

Version 2.00 (Sun Mar 22 2009)
 * Added IO::EventMux::Dump from José Micó
 * Added new function has_events as suggested by José Micó
 * Added new connect() call as shorthand for creating socket/adding it
 * Use Errno instead of POSIX as this takes less mem and is faster to load.
 * Added support for auto detecting if a socket is in listening mode or not.
   Listen => 1 on add() is no longer needed.
 * Rename "error_num" to "errno" in error events
 * Add new "Errors" options to add() that returns ICMP errors as error events.
 * Close no longer waits for send buffer to empty
 * Drop support for timeouts pr. file handle
 * Convert to new IO::Buffered and drop support for old Buffered API.
 * Added a lot more error handling, IO::EventMux now croaks when given wrong
   in a lot of cases.
 * Add credential information to unix sockets on accepted event.
 * Mux now croaks on negativ timeout value

Version 1.02 (Sun Dec 30 2007)
 * Make push_event public, so fake events can be pushed to the queue.
 * Fixed bug in fixed size buffering
 * Fix all Perl::Critic warning
 * Add experimental HTTP buffer type
 * Fixed bug in socket type detection
 * Croak when sending to a $fh that is not ours
